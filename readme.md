##About

This game is written by Linley Henzell. I played it a fair bit when I was
younger, then came back to it around 2012 when I became interested in learning
C programming. The original code was designed to work on older systems, so
I spent some time stripping out the bits that didn't work (network support)
and updated a few graphics calls. I recently took on a new project that is
somewhat inspired by this game, so to honor it, I cleaned up a few things and
got it compiling again.
